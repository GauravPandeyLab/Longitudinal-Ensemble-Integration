# Longitudinal Ensemble Integration

## Overview
This repository contains the development and implementation of Longitudinal EI, a time-series and multiclass extension of the Ensemble Integration Algorithm.
Here, LEI was used for early diagnosis trajectory prediction on ADNI patients via TADPOLE.

## Novel Algorithm
A new algorithm has been developed to address longitudinal forecasting for multi-modal patient data.

## Implementation
The repository includes a comprehensive implementation of LEI on TADPOLE. The implementation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm as well as its interpretation.

## Repository Structure
- `eipy/`: Contains the source code for LEI and its implementation.
- `tadpole_data/`: Contains the dataset used for the implementation as well as the data preparation pipeline code.
- `LEI_implement/`: Contains the execution of the LEI algorithm on the data
